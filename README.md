# PII Application

### About
This application identifies likely PII (personally identifiable information) in a dataset. To use, download the .exe from the latest release and follow the in-app directions.

This tool is current listed as an alpha release because it is completely untested on IPA PII-containing field datasets due to a lack of data access.

Ensuring the dataset is devoid of PII is ultimately still your responsibility.
