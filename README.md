# PII_detection

This script is meant to assist in the detection of PII (personally identifiable information) and subsequent removal from a dataset.

Ensuring the dataset is devoid of PII is ultimately still your responsibility. Be careful with potential identifiers, especially geographic, because they can sometimes be combined with other variables to become identifying.
