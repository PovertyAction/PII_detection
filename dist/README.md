# Caveats to consider when running .exe

* The app is still being tested. This is not a final version. Please provide feedback after using it [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxB_pnReUd0EvFfQxPu5JI9oRGCpDgULWkTeDHYoqx8x7q-Q/viewform).
* To download, click on the .exe in this page and then click on the ‘download’ button
* Windows will show warning when opening .exe. Please click on 'More info' and then 'Run anyway'.
* After double clicking on the .exe, the application will take a bit to load (~15 sec.)
* If app shows ‘Windows not responding’, it is probably not an error, but just program working in the back.
