# Caveats to consider when running pii_detector_vXXXX.zip

* The zip file contains all files needed to run the app, in addition to a .exe to execute the app, named `pii_detector_vXXXX.exe`. This `.exe` depends on all the files inside the zip, so after unzipping, you must not move the `.exe` from its folder.
* The app is still being tested. This is not a final version. Please provide feedback after using it [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxB_pnReUd0EvFfQxPu5JI9oRGCpDgULWkTeDHYoqx8x7q-Q/viewform).
* Windows might show warning when opening .exe. Please click on 'More info' and then 'Run anyway'.
* After double clicking on the .exe, the application will take a bit to load
* If app shows ‘Windows not responding’, it is probably not an error, but just program working in the back.
