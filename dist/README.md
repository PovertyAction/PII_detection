# Caveats to consider when running .exe

* To download, click on the .exe in this page and then click on the ‘download’ button
* Windows will show warning when opening .exe, accept warning to continue.
* After double clicking on the .exe, the application will take a bit to load (~15 sec.)
* If app shows ‘Windows not responding’, it is probably not an error, but just program working in the back. It should take some 10-30 seconds, after 30 seconds most probably the app crashed.
